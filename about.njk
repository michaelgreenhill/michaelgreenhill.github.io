<p>My name is Michael and I'm passionate about IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>I built this site using <a href="https://11ty.dev/">11ty.dev</a> and it's hosted on Amazon S3, served to you with an attractive domain name via CloudFront. The site is developed locally on a Windows 10 desktop in Selby, Victoria, and commited to Github where the build process ships it to S3.</p>
<p>You can read more about my professional adventures over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelgreenhill/">LinkedIn</a>, or check out my <a href="https://github.com/michaelgreenhill/">Github misadventures</a>.

<p>I'm a practicing AWS Solutions Architect for a leading consumer finance company in Melbourne's outer east. When I'm not mashing my head into a keyboard I'm usually outside taking photographs of steam trains.</p>

<p>I've done loads of cool things in my personal and professional lives. One of the achievements I'm most proud of was being asked to present at the <a href="/night-photography-part-1/">2018 Railway Photography Forum</a>.</p>
